  <p>Yeah, talk to me like you didn't want me back then</p>
  <p>I don't wanna know how you been if it's just a friend thing</p>
  <p>You like walkin' in circles, I like them different shapes</p>
  <p>It's been a couple days, still I haven't seen your face</p>
  <p>I should've known, I should've known this wasn't safe</p>

  <p>I need some more, I need some more communication</p>

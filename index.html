  <p>She got them pretty eyes, type to make you wonder </p>
  <p>Pretty lies, don't know why I showed her my</p>
  <p>Cheap disguise isn't holding over </p>
  <p>I fantasize 'bout a life that's over </p>
  <p>What's up with you girl, you've been quiet? </p>
  <p>You live in my mind uninvited</p>
  <p>All the lies that you said kept me silent</p>
  <p>Now I'm tryna get through, but you're hiding</p>


  <p class="form"> [Chorus: Marco Luka]</p>
  <p>I'm just tryna see where you are</p>
  <p>I just wanna see where your mind's been lately</p>
  <p>All the times we spent in the dark</p>
  <p>Knowing that you're something to fight for, baby</p>
  <p>I'm just tryna see where you are</p>
  <p>I just wanna see where your mind's been lately</p>
  <p>All the times we spent in the dark</p>
  <p>Knowing that you're something to fight for, baby</p>

  <p class="form">[Verse 2: Manas]</p>
  <p>Yeah, talk to me like you didn't want me back then</p>
  <p>I don't wanna know how you been if it's just a friend thing</p>
  <p>You like walkin' in circles, I like them different shapes</p>
  <p>It's been a couple days, still I haven't seen your face</p>
  <p>I should've known, I should've known this wasn't safe</p>
  <p>I gotta go, I gotta go and relocate</p>
  <p>These highs and lows, these highs and lows they come in phases</p>
  <p>I need some more, I need some more communication</p>

  <p class="form">[Bridge: Manas]</p>
  <p>Is it the way you're feeling?</p>
  <p>What do you think about at night?</p>
  <p>We live for different reasons</p>
  <p>Are you afraid to even try?</p>
  <p>Hit me hard, release your soul</p>
  <p>Free my mind of words untold</p>
  <p>Know you're scared of what's unknown</p>
  <p>I'm still tryna keep you close</p>
  <p>Hit me hard, release your soul</p>
